# Rust Sokoban Project

Welcome to my Rust Sokoban project! This project is based on the [Rust Sokoban guide](https://sokoban.iolivia.me/c01-00-intro).

## About

This project is a hands-on introduction to making a game in Rust using the new ggez library. The goal is to create a working Sokoban game while learning Rust and some basic game development concepts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
3. Follow the instructions in the guide to set up the project and start coding.

## How to Run the Application

Once you have completed the setup, you can run the application using the following commands:

1. **Build the Project:**
   ```sh

   ```

2. **Run the Game:**

   ```
Happy coding!
